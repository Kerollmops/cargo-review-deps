# cargo-review-deps

A cargo subcommand for reviewing the source code of crates.io dependencies.

## Installation:

```
cargo install cargo-review-deps
```

## Usage

### update-diff

To see what exactly changes if you run `cargo-update`, use

```
$ cargo review-deps update-diff -- --package foo
```

This will run (without actually updating the lockfile) `cargo update --package foo`
and show `diff --color -r` of all added/removed/updated dependencies.

If you want to use a custom diff tool or need to do a more thorough
investigation, use `--destination` option to checkout sources of dependencies
locally.

### diff

To quickly see the `diff -r` of two package versions, use

```
$ cargo review-deps diff rand:0.6.0 rand:0.6.1
```

Similarly to `update-diff`, you can use `--destination` option for customized
diffing.

```
$ cargo review-deps diff rand:0.6.0 rand:0.6.1 --destinations diff
```

The `diff/random:0.6.0` and `diff/random:0.6.1` directories would
contain the sources of the respective versions.

Note that `cargo-review-deps` does not rely on version control information: it
uses exactly that version of source code, that will be used by Cargo to build
your project.


### current

To see the sources of all transitive dependencies, use

```
$ cargo review-deps current --destination dir/to/dump/sources/to
```

This will download sources of all of the dependencies to the specified
directory.
